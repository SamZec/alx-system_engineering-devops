#  Postmortem For An Compressor Outage At Niche Cocoa Industry Ghana LTD.

## Summary:
The compressor powering the moulded chocolate cooler broke down while running
on the 2nd day of April around 10:00 hours GMT till the 10th day of May 15:00
hours GMT. The plant and the line was down which affected production since is
the only source for the cooler. There was inbalance in the pressure due to
faulty pressure valves causing the compressor to breakdown.

## Timeline:
* The issue was detected around 09:00 hours GMT when the compressor tripped
* The issue was detected by an engineer who investigated the tripping issue.
* The was noise and vibrations in the compressor and it was assumed that a
  mechanical damge has occured. The utility responsible for the compressor was
  called upon to investigate further.
* The windings were checked, terminals checked, refrigrant were also checked.
* The issue was escalated to the utility team who consulted the provider.
* The issue was resolved by changing the pressure valves that were faulty.

## Root cause and Resolution:
- The root cause of the issue was the pressure valves that were not functioning
properly. When the piston of the compressor is moving to both suck and
discharge refrigrant, the low pressure vlaves must open at suction wahile the
high ones should open at discharge. But one of the high pressure valve was
constantly open causing the inbalance in the system and putting more pressure on
the compressor.

- The valves were opened and examined. The bad ones were replaced with a new set
by the provider with support from both the utility team and the electrical. From
dismantling to re-assembling, refilling of refrigrant and testing.

## Corrective and Preventative:
* Oil separator has been fixed on the pipe line which will collect and return
any oil mixed with the refrigrant after compressing back to yhe oil resevoir
preventing it from going into the line.
* Controller for current has been fixed on the power to monitor the current
of the compreesor at a set point safe above which will trip the compressor
and notify technicians.
* The ambient temperature has been improved.

Now the operators, technicians both electrical and mechanical, the utilities
have been task to ensure that proper routine are followed in operating the
compressor to pravent further issues ocurring to the compressor. Checks must be
done before the compressor is started, during operation and after operatios.
Utilities record pressure points at 1 hour interval during the operatios of the compressor to monitor the pressure of the compressor.
